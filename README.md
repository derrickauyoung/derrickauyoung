<p>My official journey into programming began in 1999 where I studied Computer Science at UCLA (go bruins!), but my fascination with code started in the early days of the interwebs, where I taught myself HTML and building personal web pages. At University, I pulled all-nighters writing in C and C++. Today, I am most comfortable in python, can find my way around C++, and am dipping my pinky toe into learning how machine (deep) learning works. I just <b>love</b> learning! I've dabbled in a bit of React/Javascript, and run-time animation programming (and math!) for game engines, including Unreal. And most recently, I've started experimenting with ComfyUI workflows in my endless pursuit of creative enablement.</p>

<p><i>But first</i> a bit of background...</p>

<p>Ever since <em>Jurassic Park</em> stomped all over cinemas and my eyeballs in 1993, I wanted to somehow forge a career combining technology and film, so I grabbed every book I could find on Visual Effects at the time (and studied them cover-to-cover) and eventually crafted a minor at UCLA in Design/Media Arts with a focus in Film. As soon as I graduated in 2003, I landed my dream job as a Pipeline Intern at <em>Rhythm & Hues Studios</em> in Los Angeles, working my way up to Lead Animation Layout TD on <em>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em>. We really thought we had a shot at the Visual Effects Oscar with that one, until a little shop in NZ nabbed their fourth in a row, with <em>King Kong</em>!</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2006, and I landed another dream job in Wellington, New Zealand, at that little shop called <em>Weta Digital</em> (now <em>WƒìtƒÅ FX</em>), as an Animation Technical Director, and have been lucky enough to build pipeline and tooling for Animators and Motion artists on films like:

  * _Avatar_
  * _The Hobbit_ Trilogy
  * _The Planet of the Apes_ Trilogy (Rise, Dawn, War)

From 2016-2024, I managed our exceptional team of Motion R&D engineers to help deliver projects like:
  * _Avengers: Infinity War + Endgame_
  * _Avatar: The Way of Water_
  * _The Last of Us_ Season 1
  * _The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes_

I also had the great opportunity to be a character animator on:
  * Caesar, _Rise of the Planet of the Apes_ (Weta Digital)
  * African Animals Exhibit, Old West Exhibit crowd shots, _Night at the Museum_ (Rhythm & Hues)
  * Aslan, _The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_ (Rhythm & Hues)

</p>

I'm very grateful for being able to collaborate and learn from the best in the industry and it is a _massive_ understatement to say that I really do stand on the shoulders of giants.
