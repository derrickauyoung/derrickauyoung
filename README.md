<p>My official journey into programming began in 1999 where I studied Computer Science at UCLA, but my fascination with code started in the early days of the interwebs, where I taught myself HTML and building personal web pages.<br>
Ever since <em>Jurassic Park</em> stomped all over cinemas and my eyeballs in 1993, I wanted to somehow forge a career in technology and film, so I minored in Design/Media Arts. As soon as I graduated in 2003, I landed my dream job as a Pipeline Intern at <em>Rhythm & Hues Studios</em> in Los Angeles, working my way up to Lead Animation Layout TD.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2006, and I landed another dream job at <em>Weta Digital</em> (now <em>WƒìtƒÅ FX</em>), as an Animation Technical Director, and have been lucky enough to build pipeline and tooling for Animators and Motion artists on films like:

  * _Avatar_
  * _The Hobbit_ Trilogy
  * _The Planet of the Apes_ Trilogy (Rise, Dawn, War)

More recently, I've also been lucky enough to manage our exceptional team of Motion R&D engineers on:
  * _Avengers: Infinity War + Endgame_
  * _Avatar: The Way of Water_
  * _The Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes_

</p>

I'm very grateful for being able to collaborate and learn from the best in the industry and it is a _massive_ understatement to say that I really do stand on the shoulders of giants.
